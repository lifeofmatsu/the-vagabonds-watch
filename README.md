## Description
This project is part of the UCSD Coding Bootcamp and aims to provide a convenient tool for users to look up the time and time zone of specific locations. Additionally, it allows users to view a history of previously searched locations.


## User Story 
As a Traveler (or 'Vagabond'), I want to easily look up the time and time zone of a specific location and have the ability to view a history of locations I've previously searched for.


## Usage
#### Homepage Interface: 
Upon opening the site, users are greeted with a clear homepage displaying a search bar dedicated to entering specific locations.

#### Search Functionality:
Upon entering a location in the search bar, users should be seamlessly redirected to a new page displaying detailed time and time zone information for the specified location.

#### Real-Time Updates: 
The displayed time should be continuously updated in real-time to reflect accurate information.

#### Search History: 
Users can access a collection of their searched time zones, enabling them to view their search history.

#### User Data Storage: 
Upon revisiting the website, all user-specific data, including search history, is securely stored and accessible to users.
